An interactive visualization of different sorting algorithms, using Fiatlight

Here is the strategy that we will be using:

- The function make_random_number_list will create a random unordered set of numbers between
  one and a given maximum. This will be the set that we will be sorting.
- The function swap_elements will swap two elements in a set with a configurable latency in order
  to be able to visually compare the speed
- We will implement different sorting strategies. Each strategy will be a function that will accept an unordered set
  and return it after sorting. We will implement the following strategies:
    - Bubble sort
    - Selection sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort

Later on we will work on creating a visualization for all of them.
